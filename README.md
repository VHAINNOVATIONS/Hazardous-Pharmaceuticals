HazardousPharmceuticals
=======================

VHA Innovation Project 665

Every VA pharmacy carries pharmaceuticals that present hazards for human exposure during handling and environmental hazards upon disposal. This application  modifies VistA to properly identify hazardous pharmaceuticals for handling precautions and disposal instructions. The goal is to protect the Veterans, VA staff, and the environment. The Haz Pharm software accomplishes this by implementing a national hazardous pharmaceutical drug file marking in a computer database; a National (PPS-N) enhancement to store hazard data downloaded from external source; a National Drug File (NDF)/VistA Pharmacy enhancement to provide pharmacy look-up file, disposal labeling and reporting local medication when necessary to reflect state variation in EPA code; and finally with a Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) enhancement to provide nursing with warnings of drug hazards prior to handling.
