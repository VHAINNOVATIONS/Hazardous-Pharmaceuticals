    <missedDose><![CDATA[MISSED DOSE:  For the best possible benefit, do not miss any doses. If you do miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember if it is on the same day. If it is the next day, skip the missed dose and resume your usual dosing schedule. Do not double the dose to catch up because this could increase your risk for bleeding. Keep a record of missed doses to give to your doctor or pharmacist. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you miss 2 or more doses in a row.]]></missedDose>

    <drugInteractions><![CDATA[DRUG INTERACTIONS:  Your doctor or pharmacist may already be aware of any possible drug interactions and may be monitoring you for them. Do not start, stop, or change the dosage of any drug, vitamin, or herbal product without checking with your doctor or pharmacist first.Warfarin interacts with many prescription, nonprescription, vitamin, and herbal products. This includes medications that are applied to the skin or inside the vagina or rectum. The following interactions listed do not contain all possible drug interactions. The interactions with warfarin usually result in an increase or decrease in the "blood-thinning" (anticoagulant) effect. Patients taking warfarin should be closely monitored to prevent serious bleeding or clotting problems.This drug should not be used with the following medication because a very serious interaction may occur: mifepristone.If you are currently taking the medication listed above, tell your doctor or pharmacist before starting warfarin.Aspirin and aspirin-like drugs (salicylates) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib) may have effects similar to warfarin. These drugs may increase the risk of bleeding problems if taken during treatment with warfarin. Carefully check all prescription/nonprescription product labels (including drugs applied to the skin such as pain-relieving creams) since they may contain NSAIDs or salicylates. Low-dose aspirin and related drugs (e.g., clopidogrel, ticlopidine) should be continued if prescribed by your doctor for specific medical reasons such as heart attack or stroke prevention. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about using these products safely.Many herbal medications have "blood-thinning" or "blood-clotting" effects, and some may directly affect warfarin. Tell your doctor before taking any herbal medications, especially bromelains, coenzyme Q10, cranberry, danshen, dong quai, fenugreek, garlic, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, goldenseal, St. Johns wort, among others.While taking warfarin, it is important to eat a balanced, consistent diet. Avoid sudden large increases or decreases in your intake of foods high in vitamin K (e.g., liver, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kale, spinach and other green leafy vegetables, green tea, certain vitamin supplements) because doing so may change the effect of this medication.This medication can affect the results of a certain lab test (theophylline level). Make sure laboratory personnel and all your doctors know you use this drug.]]></drugInteractions>

    <uses><![CDATA[USES:  This medication is used to treat blood clots and/or to prevent new clots from forming in your body. Preventing harmful blood clots helps to reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack. Conditions that increase your risk of developing blood clots include a certain type of irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), heart valve replacement, and recent heart attack.Warfarin is commonly called a "blood thinner," but its more correct term is anticoagulant. It helps to keep blood flowing smoothly in your body by decreasing the amount of certain substances (clotting proteins) in your blood.]]></uses>

    <warnings><![CDATA[WARNING:  Warfarin can cause serious, possibly fatal bleeding, which is more likely to occur when patients first start this medication and/or when taking too high of a dose. The risk is greater in patients older than 65 years and in those with major injuries/surgeries, previous stomach/intestinal bleeding, or stroke. Your doctor or other healthcare provider will monitor you closely to decrease your risk. Keep all medical/lab appointments. (See also Precautions section.)]]></warnings>
