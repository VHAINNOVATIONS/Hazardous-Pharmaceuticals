 aGE("Health Data Repository-Interim Messaging Solution (HDR-IMS)","The pre-HDR II interim solution for nationalizing viewable, patient-centric clinical data. The HDR IMS will collect data from 128 VistA systems in at least four clinical domains from the point at which the data is standardized in the VistA system going forward. HDR IMS will ultimately be replaced by HDR II. Prior to the deployment of HDR II, HDR IMS will be a data provider to CDS.");
 aGE("Health Level Seven (HL7) Messaging","A standardized messaging protocol that is common to medical applications.");

 aGE("Hibernate","A powerful, ultra-high performance object/relational persistence and query service for Java. It allows for the development of persistent classes following common Java idiom–including association, inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and the Java collections framework. The Query Language, designed as a “minimal” object-oriented extension to SQL, provides a bridge between the object and relational worlds. Also allows for the expression of queries using native SQL or Java-based Criteria and Example queries.");

For doses, a user specifies how many doses to “Hold” and the system automatically calculates the date/time associated with the doses. A Patient’s “Active Orders” can also be automatically placed on “Hold” when there is a Patient movement event (i.e., admission, discharge, transfer, pass). In this case, the “Hold” is manually removed by an authorized user.");

Patient charges (pharmacy, Inpatient, and Outpatient co-payments, as well as per diems) are automatically processed.");
 aGE("Integrated Funds Distribution, Control Point Activity, Accounting and Procurement (IFCAP)","A VistA application that automates a spectrum of VA financial activities. VA employees use IFCAP to manage budgets, order goods and services, maintain records of available funds, determine the status of a request, compare Vendors, and items to determine the best purchase, record the receipt of items into the warehouse, and pay vendors.
