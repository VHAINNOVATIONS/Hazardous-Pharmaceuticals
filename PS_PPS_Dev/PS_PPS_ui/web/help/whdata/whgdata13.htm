 aGE("Service","A logical grouping of capabilities that support a common business process. Thus a “drug information service” might provide capabilities that allow for the searching of different types of drug information and different types of searches for the same information (i.e., searching for a drug by Generic Name, NDC, Therapeutic category). This is loosely analogous to the class-method relationship, in which a class is composed of multiple methods that support the usage of the class.");
 aGE("Service (Architecture)","A logical grouping of related software capabilities that share common business goals in a functional process and communicate through a well-defined interface mechanism.");
 aGE("Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)","A system architecture that encourages the development, collection and use of software services. These services communicate with each other. The communication can involve either simple data passing or it could involve two or more services coordinating to complete an activity. Services require a standardized communication protocol.");
 aGE("Session Bean","A reusable software component that is used to implement business logic; it can be of stateless or stateful variety; its existence is short-lived; and its purpose is to execute on behalf of a single client.");
 aGE("Session Façade","Decouples the user of the service from the multiple entity beans that may reside behind a service method by providing a common session bean for that particular service. For example, most service method calls will require two distinct events to complete: one to authenticate that the user is authorized to use the service, and the second is to invoke the capability of the service method. It hides these event invocations from the client, providing them with one session bean that handles all subsequent method invocations required to complete the service method request.");
 aGE("SGML","Standard Generalized Markup Language");
 aGE("SHG","Strategic Health Group");
 aGE("Shortage","A deficit between inventory available and inventory required.");
 aGE("SIG","The Latin word, Signatura, abbreviated as “SIG.” (also called SIG, or transcription), which gives instructions to the Patient on how, how much, when, and how long the drug is to be taken. These written instructions are preceded by the symbol “S” or “SIG.” from the Latin, meaning “mark.” The signature should always be written in English; however, Physicians continue to insert Latin abbreviations, e.g., “1 cap t.i.d. pc,” which the Pharmacist translates into English when he or she prints the label, such as “take one capsule three times daily after meals.” The purpose of the prescription, special instructions, and warnings, followed by the signature of the prescriber, may also be included.");
 aGE("Sign Order","The action taken by a user to provide a signature on an order that is legally binding. In the system, the signature is an electronic signature. See glossary term Electronic Signature.");
 aGE("SIL","Security Integration Laboratory");
 aGE("Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)","A lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML-based protocol that consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined data types, and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses.");
 aGE("Single Sign-On","A set of software components, usually distributed over a network, which allow a user to log into his workstation once, and thereafter start applications without having further authentication required.");
 aGE("Smart Card","In the VA/DEA PKI Pilot, the clinician uses a smart card to digitally sign Outpatient medication orders for Schedule 2 and Schedule 2n CS after using the current electronic signature process within CPRS. The technologies used in PKI add security for these substances. Smart cards have the clinician’s photo and an integrated circuit (a computer chip) that stores other information such as demographics, access and verity codes, a personal identification number (PIN), and a digital certificate.");

 aGE("Software Development Plan (SDP)","A comprehensive, composite artifact that gathers all information required to manage the project. It encompasses a number of artifacts developed during the Initiation phase and is maintained throughout the project.");
 aGE("Software Package","A software term for a high-level, common grouping of one or more components within a system.");
 aGE("Software Quality Assurance (SQA)","The set of activities that defines and implements software quality into the process and encompasses systematic activities that provide evidence that the product meets the customer’s expectations, in terms of use and the associated quality factors. This includes monitoring the methods and standards used, and then verifying that they have been properly applied. Also tracks that the required procedures have taken place during the SDLC. It does this by auditing the quality actions of the products in development and alerting management to any deviations.");
 aGE("Software Quality Assurance Team","Oversees all aspects of quality assurance in each OED project.");
 aGE("Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)","A document that outlines and records the requirements for a project. The document formally states the requirements for the project.");

 aGE("SOP","Standard Operating Procedure");
 aGE("SOW","Statement of Work");
 aGE("Special Handling","The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) special handling codes used to designate drug products as over-the-counter, narcotics, bulk compounds, supply items. Requirements exist for each code that determines how a drug product is to be handled and/or stored.");

Normally stakeholders are from within the company (e.g., internal clients, management, employees, administrators). A project may also have external stakeholders, including suppliers, investors, community groups, and government organizations.");
 aGE("Standard Data Service (SDS)","Consists of architecture service components to support the migration of applications from M-based VistA to new HealtheVet-VistA architecture. The major purpose of SDS is to provide a centralized repository of standard (non-clinical) administrative data together with a data maintenance mechanism and a distribution capability for transporting the data to HealtheVet-VistA applications.");
