 aGE("Virtual Due List (VDL)","A list of medications that need to be administered to a Patient within a specified time parameter. These include active Continuous, PRN, On-Call, and One-Time medication orders.");
 aGE("Virtual Private Network (VPN)","A scheme where a portion of a network is connected via Internet, but information sent across the Internet is encrypted. The result is a “virtual network,” which is also part of a larger network entity. This enables users to privately share private information over a public infrastructure.");
 aGE("Vision Document","The stakeholder’s view of the product to be developed specified in terms of the stakeholders key needs and features. It provides the contractual basis for the more detailed technical requirements.");
 aGE("Visit","A Patient event that begins when the Patient arrives at a clinic for medical evaluation or treatment and concludes when the Patient departs.");

 aGE("VistA Data Systems and Integration Service (VDSI)","The service group that manages VistA system changes to ensure compliance with standards and regulating bodies; ensures resource impacts are assessed to allow sufficient time for equipment or software procurements as needed; manages and maintains the VistA data architecture working in close association with OED Program Directors and manages technical/application integration oversight, support, and tools to ensure products inter-operate effectively and make maximal use of existing software tools. VDSI performs five required reviews of VistA products to support these goals, which are typically performed at specific points in the software development lifecycle.");

 aGE("Visual Flow Management","This term is referring to visual systems or the establishment of a visual workplace in which the ultimate outcome is visual information sharing. The bingo board is just a simple example. It provides immediate visual information to the observer. There are numerous visual tools that could be put in place in the pharmacy that would supplement the use of the new PRE system as well as improve Pharmacy work processes. For example, the bin described in “visual order” could include a visual display of the expiration date of items in the bin.");
 aGE("Visual Order","In the context of inventory management, refers to the use of a physical visual signal or indication that an item needs to be replenished. This might be an empty bin in which its physical condition (empty) generates an automatic refilling action. That single visual signal could trigger real time replenishment from a supply cart. No computer transaction is required at that time. Appropriate use of this process tool would multiply a pharmacy’s capability when combined with the PRE system. The size of the bin determines the Par Level, the fact that is empty defines the Usage, and the Reorder Point, the filling action defines Replenishment. A single computer transaction recording the filling event would generate the tracking and ordering requirements that normally require multiple and time wasting separate transactions including scanning use, generating a pick list, withdrawing from supply, scanning replenishment, and generating a procurement order. See glossary term Visual Flow Management.");
