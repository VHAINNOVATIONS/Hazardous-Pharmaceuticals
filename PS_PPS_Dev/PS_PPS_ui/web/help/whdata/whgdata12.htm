For Outpatient orders, the renew action creates a new order with a new prescription number and a new expiration date. For Inpatient orders, renew action does not create a new order. In Inpatient renew, a new Default Stop Date/Time is calculated for the existing order.");
 aGE("Renewal","A new order that was generated by the renew process. See glossary term Renew.");
 aGE("Reorder Amount","The quantity of an item to be ordered from the replenishment source when a Reorder signal is sent. It is triggered by the status of the inventory control factors, usually when the quantity remaining reaches the reorder point.");
 aGE("Reorder Point","The quantity level at which the reorder signal is sent.");

 aGE("Replenishment","The inventory items used to restock user area locations (e.g., ward stock, automated dispensing devices) without being tied to a Patient order. These tend to be commonly used items stored for easy access at quantity levels required for Patient safety and work process flow. Quantities are debited from pharmacy supply locations but are still carried in inventory as unallocated. The item location changes from pharmacy supply to user area. Usage from the user area debits inventory from that area. See related glossary term Dispensed Inventory.");

 aGE("Requirement","A criterion that a system or software must meet. It can include things the system must do, characteristics it must have, and levels of performance it must attain. Systems engineers develop them before a system is created. As it is developed, the system is evaluated according to how well it meets its criterion. Requirements may be business, functional, and/or system needs. They are documented in detail in the System Requirements Specification document.");
