 aGE("Inventory Forecast","An estimation of future demand of pharmacy products for use in procurement planning. The system will have a capability to calculate estimated future inventory requirements based on historical demand (see glossary term Usage). There will be some functionality to include adjustment factors such as consumption trends, seasonality, and management actions.");
 aGE("Inventory Group","The group of pharmacy users responsible for deriving requirements for the inventory functional area associated with the future PRE system.");
 aGE("Inventory Location","A physical storage location that is formally defined for each inventory item and tracked by the IT system. This is a key element in the inventory system as location must be known if quantities are to be managed and controlled. Inventory locations will be defined for all user locations as well as central supply areas. It may be in the form of a room, vault, shelf, shelf location, or automated dispensing or storage device. The level to which inventory locations are defined will be flexible and determined by the local facility. Each location has the primary replenishment location (or outside Vendor) from which to replenish the inventory.");
 aGE("Inventory Order","A transaction that involves the movement of a product from one location to another. Examples include Sales Orders (order from outside Vendor), Forecast Order (non-binding forecast of projected inventory usage to an outside Vendor), Transfer Order (transfer inventory from one location to another location, including inter-site locations), Waste Order (an order to dispose of inventory, usually for expired or recalled stock), Dispense Order (inventory to be given to a customer), and other orders including Borrow Orders, Lend Orders, Shipping Orders, and Replenishment Orders.");
 aGE("Inventory Supply Specialist","The default role for an inventory employee. It is used when only “Inventory” permissions are required for an action. For example, moving a product, pulling a product, counting, etc.");
 aGE("Inventory Turns","The number of times inventory turns over during a one-year period. The higher the inventory turns, the better the organization is using its inventory assets. A low number indicates excess or unused inventory. It is generally calculated by dividing the total annual inventory usage (annual cost of inventory investment) by the average inventory level (or current level). The national average for hospitals is 12-13, while consultants recommend 15-18.");

 aGE("Item","A generic type representing one conceptual entity consisting of a collection of data fields. For example, a medication may contain the following collection of data fields: Product Name, Generic Name, Trade Name, Dosage Form, NDC, etc. Conceptual entities include Medications, Supplies, and Investigationals.");
 aGE("Iteration","The smallest segment of activity in an Iterative Development Process (IDP). Iterations reside within a phase and have a distinct plan, objective, and evaluation criteria. A distinct sequence of activities with a base-lined plan and valuation criteria resulting in a release (internal or external). An iteration usually lasts two or three weeks and starts with a planning meeting.");
 aGE("Iterative Development Lifecycle (IDL)","A process that confronts issues early on, driven by architecture, technology, risk, and customer priorities. It assumes requirements are not fully known at project start and supports showing early prototypes to customers. It uses component-based development, forcing early elaboration of infrastructure; common mechanisms control structures and Configuration Management principles to manage sharing.");
 aGE("Iterative Development Process (IDP)","A partitioning of the development of the system modules into iterations. In successive iterations, grows the system by developing more and more modules, while making necessary changes along the way as more is learned about the system.");

Java is a simple, robust, object-oriented, platform-independent multi-threaded, dynamic general-purpose programming environment. It is best for creating applets and applications for the Internet, Intranets, and any other complex, distributed networks.");

This makes it easy to incorporate XML data and processing functions in applications based on Java technology without having to possess extensive XML knowledge.");
 aGE("JavaBeans","A platform-independent software component technology for building reusable Java components called “beans.” Once built, these beans can be made available for use by other software engineers or can be used in Java applications. Using JavaBeans, software engineers can manipulate and assemble beans in a graphical drag-and-drop development environment.");
 aGE("Javascript","A scripting language for Web pages, JavaScript can be written and embedded into HTML documents. JavaScript was designed to resemble Java, which in turn looks a lot like C and C++. The difference is that Java was built as a general purpose object language, while JavaScript is intended to provide a quicker and simpler language for enhancing Web pages and servers.");

 aGE("Just-In-Time (JIT)","A term that describes an inventory management objective of the right inventory in the right quantity arriving just at the time of need. JIT is actually a process for optimizing the pharmacy processes for inventory use by eliminating all process waste including wasted steps, wasted movement, wasted material, excess inventory, etc. In theory, some stock rooms in pharmacy could be eliminated or reduced in size if a vendor could deliver directly to the area of use JIT. A real world example is the bread shelves in your grocery store. These are stocked by the bread vendor JIT, and using visual orders. The grocery store does not have a bread stock room in the back.");

It is not an operating system, but a set of utilities and associated files that are executed in an M environment. It is central to VA Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP) software strategy, in that it permits any DHCP software application to run without modification on any hardware/software platform that supports American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard M. All operating system-specific, M implementation-specific, or hardware-specific code is isolated to this environment.");
