 <entry name="Visual Flow Management" value="This term is referring to visual systems or the establishment of a visual workplace in which the ultimate outcome is visual information sharing. The bingo board is just a simple example. It provides immediate visual information to the observer. There are numerous visual tools that could be put in place in the pharmacy that would supplement the use of the new PRE system as well as improve Pharmacy work processes. For example, the bin described in “visual order” could include a visual display of the expiration date of items in the bin." />
 <entry name="Visual Order" value="In the context of inventory management, refers to the use of a physical visual signal or indication that an item needs to be replenished. This might be an empty bin in which its physical condition (empty) generates an automatic refilling action. That single visual signal could trigger real time replenishment from a supply cart. No computer transaction is required at that time. Appropriate use of this process tool would multiply a pharmacy’s capability when combined with the PRE system. The size of the bin determines the Par Level, the fact that is empty defines the Usage, and the Reorder Point, the filling action defines Replenishment. A single computer transaction recording the filling event would generate the tracking and ordering requirements that normally require multiple and time wasting separate transactions including scanning use, generating a pick list, withdrawing from supply, scanning replenishment, and generating a procurement order. See glossary term Visual Flow Management." />
